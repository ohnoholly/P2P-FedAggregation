# Peer-to-peer Federated Aggregation
This repository contains two implementations for two modules in a peer-to-peer federated learning setup. One is P2PK-SMOTE [1], a data rebalance aiming to rebalance the private datasets of clients and address the non-IID problem in federated learning. Another is SparSFA [2], a communication-efficient and robust aggregation rule which can be used to defend against poisoning attacks.
